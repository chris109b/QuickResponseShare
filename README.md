# QuickResponseShare
A desktop application to  share files on demand with mobile devices in the same local area network.

Using the integration with your file manager sharing files with a mobile device in the same loacal area network couldn't be easyer.
This is how it works in dayly use:
* In your file manager select the files you want to share.
* Open the context menue of your selection (right klick).
* Choose "Quick share n files"

Now you see a window with a qrcode inside and an URI underneath, followed by a button to toggle through your network interfaces. The right network interface should be allready selected.

* Grab your Android Phone, Windows Phone, iPhone, Android Tablett, iPad, iPod Touch, Ubuntu Phone or whatever mobile device you have.
* Fire up your QR code scanner app (e.g. Barcode Scanner, by ZXing Team, my recommedation)
* Scan the code from your computers screen.
* Choose "Open in Browser".

Now on your mobile device you should see a list of all the files you have shared, ready for download individually by taping on the files name.
